# Learn 2d ellipses patterns with different flavors of Decision Forests

Train different types of decision forest models (Random Forest, Gradient boosted trees, dart, Extremly Randomized Trees, etc.) on a 2D ellipse pattern with various amount of training data. Models are trained with [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests).
